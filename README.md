# Simple-Shell
This is a clone of simple shell using python language. This project is aimed to build a bash shell like system 

## Project Description
This simple shell implements a basic command prompt loop that allows users to execute commands and navigate directories using a similar interface to the Bash shell. It supports changing directories with the cd command and executing other commands using the os.system method.

To use the shell, save the code in a file (e.g. Simple-Shell.py) and run it from the command line using pythonSimple-Shell.py. You can then enter commands as you would in a normal shell.

Note that this is a very basic example, and you may want to add more functionality or error handling depending on your specific use case.
